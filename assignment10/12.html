    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h2>
    <p>
      Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing
      (PIAIC)<br />
      is a privately funded notfor-profit educational initiative started by<br />
      President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to
      help<br />
      promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech<br />
      fields like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/"> Cloud Native Computing</a></li>
      <li> <a href="/"> Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
      <li> <a href="/"> Blockchain </a></li>
      <li> <a href="/"> Internet Of Things</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cloud Native computing:</h3>
    <p>
      The <b> Cloud Native Computing </b> program prepares the students to
      program in <br />
      open source technologies like,
      <b>
        <i>
          Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript,<br />
          Node.js, React and React Native
        </i>
        </b
      >while introducing the students to<br />
      development of Microservices and software development techniques on
      cloud<br />
      platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>artificial intelligence</b>  program of PIAIC takes the student through the
      foundation of the AI<br />
      technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b> <i> Python,
      Numpy, Pandas,<br />
      Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask</i></b> , and teaching deploying practical AI solutions
      and use cases, and<br />
      ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h3>Blockchain:</h3>
    <p>
      The main emphasis of <b> Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains
      like <b> <i> Ethereum <br />
      and Hyperledger (Fabric)</i></b>, and learn to program in languages such as
      Solidity, JavaScript on<br />
      frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development
      of Distributed Apps<br />
      (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of
      Blockchain-as-aservice<br />
      (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a
      crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h3>Internet of Things:</h3>
    <p>
      The <b> Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source<br />
      development technologies like <i> Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper,<br />
      Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes </i> while making them efficient in<br />
      developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for<br />
      device control.
